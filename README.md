👋 Hi there! My name is Gordon Banh
👀 I’m interested in utilizing everyday data to help make better decisions. Data tells a story, and I love to story tell.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Data Analysis projects that you are excited about.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin! 
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I come from a Mechanical Engineering background managing utilities, oil and gas, and sustainability projects. I am looking to grow my skillset in data analytics and help others make better decisions while leveraging everyday technology. Technology is growing at a fast pace and I am excited to grow alongside it.
