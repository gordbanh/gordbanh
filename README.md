- 👋 Hi there! My name is Gordon Banh
- 👀 I’m interested in utilizing everyday data to help make better decisions. Data tells a story, and I love to story tell.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Data Analysis projects that you are excited about.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on Linkedin! If you're looking to chat about the Data Analytics, or anything that interests you, I am all ears :). I am always looking to build relationships on my journey.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I come from a Mechanical Engineering background managing utilities, oil and gas, and sustainability projects. I am looking to grow my skillset in data analytics and help others make better decisions while leveraging everyday technology. Technology is growing at a fast pace and I am excited to grow alongside it. Some of my hobbies include Improv, Dancing, and Self-Improvement. On vacation, I am a thrill seeker, so you can catch me Surfing, Snowboarding, Canyoning, Scuba Diving, and etc.
